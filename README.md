# üè• Coding Assesment

This C# console application processes ADT (Admit, Discharge, Transfer) events to determine valid and invalid patient encounters based on sequencing and logical rules.

---
üìÇ The `Output` folder contains the final file named `Encounter_Records_Output.xlsx`, which has two sheets: **Valid Records** and **Invalid Records**.
**When you run the project it delete old output file and genereate a new one**

‚úÖ **Valid Records**: Records that follow all business rules and represent complete or ongoing encounters.

‚ùå **Invalid Records**: Records that violate one or more business rules, such as missing admits, overlapping encounters, or unexpected transfers.

Note : Each patient can have only one encounter record
## ‚úÖ Assumptions

1. **Discharge Without Admit is Invalid**  
   A discharge event that occurs before any admit event for the same patient is considered invalid.

2. **Multiple Admits at the Same Hospital**  
   When multiple admit events exist for the same patient at the same hospital:
    - The **Start Date** is taken from the **first admit**.
    - The **Chief Complaint** and **Level of Care** are updated from the **latest admit**.

3. **Transfer Without Discharge is Invalid**  
   If a patient is admitted to a new hospital without a discharge from the previous hospital, the new admit is marked invalid.

4. **Ongoing Admissions Are Considered Valid**  
   An admit event without a corresponding discharge is treated as valid. The **Length of Stay** is as 0 for them as they have not been discharged yet.
5. **If any of **PatientID**, **HospitalName**, **EventDate**, or **EventType** is missing or invalid, the record will be treated as an **Invalid Record****


## üìö Class Responsibilities

- **Encounter.cs**: The main entry point that orchestrates reading, processing, and exporting encounter data.
- **AdtEventLoader.cs**: Loads ADT event data from a CSV file into memory.
- **EncounterProcessor.cs**: Processes events to group them into valid or invalid patient encounters based on business rules.
- **EncounterOutputProcessor.cs**: Exports the processed records into an Excel file with separate sheets for valid and invalid encounters.
- **Models/AdtEvent.cs**: Represents a raw ADT event record from the input file.
- **Models/EncounterRecord.cs**: Defines the structure for a valid patient encounter.
- **Models/InvalidEncounterRecord.cs**: Defines the structure for an invalid encounter with a description of the issue.
- **Constants/ErrorMessages.cs**: Contains standardized error messages used throughout the processing for consistency.
